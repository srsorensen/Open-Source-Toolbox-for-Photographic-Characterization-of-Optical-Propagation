This repository contains a python script for scattering analysis of waveguide structures to be used with any USB camera driver.

A step-by-step guide for first time use of the script can be seen below:

The scattering analysis is all contained within the SPA class. The function require four optimizable parameters, the left/right indentation, num_neighbors and rows. The class will itself suggest optimized parameters based on a provided image, alternatively these parameters may also be entered manually.
