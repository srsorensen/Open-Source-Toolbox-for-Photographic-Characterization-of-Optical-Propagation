# Open-Source-Toolbox-for-Photographic-Estimation-of-Propagation-Loss
This repository contains a python script for scattering analysis of waveguide structures to be used with any USB camera driver.

A step-by-step guide for first time use of the script can be seen below. Also see example.py.

The scattering analysis is all contained within the SPA class and has been created for a laser input on the left. Images can be rotated using the spa.rotate_image function.

The spa.analyse_image function require four hyper parameters, the left/right indentation, num_neighbors and rows.
By providing an image and running the functions find_optimal_left_indent, find_optimal_right_indent and find_optimal_sum_width, an estimated optimal value will be provided. Alternatively, these values can manually be input.

The optimal values are found by running the spa.analyse_image function for a range of the specific hyper parameter and subsequently choosing the global minimum in the range of the hyper parameter.

The optimization of the hyper parameters are done by using an initial right_indent value. This is possible as the right indent is largely constant, figures/right_indent. 

In using these optimization functions the four figures seen in figures/xxx are produced. More figures can be generated using the SPA class, these have been commented out but have all been used for different purposes.

The spa.analyse_image function returns the propagation loss and uncertainty of the fit (both in dB/cm), the R^2 of the fit, the x and y dataset used for the fit.
